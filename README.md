# Planet Ethereum
1. Technology is but a tool, what use is there to it then, if it's not a tool for good.
2. The Ethereum ecosystem can be a tool for good, if like any other complex organism,
all its individual parts collaborate and communicate directly with the goals of sustaining
the organism itself, and improving the being of individual parts.

The combination of these two points, is the broad vision of Planet Ethereum. In order to
achieve this vision, we have defined our values and mission as follows.

## Mission
This community project strives to research and implement methods which produce the most effect in the following directions:

1. As the planet is largely unexplored, to make it easy to experiment, and reduce the cost of experimentation, by stressing a strong devtool infrastructure.

2. To provide a means for experienced community members to mentor those who are new and learning.

3. To facilitate the exchange of ideas, and through that, the forming of teams, who in turn start new adventures.

4. In trying to achieve these goals, try to use decentralized applications and tools over centralized ones.

5. Encourage value-driven development.

6. To support projects which benefit the community, but don't yet have a viable mean of sustaining themselves.

7. And above all, to encourage a spirit of collaboration, and increase network effects.

## Contribute

2. Add issues, feature requests or ideas for new tools you might have here
3. Mentor beginners, and provide educational content
4. Help fund the issues, through platforms such as Gitcoin and The Bounties Network
5. Spread the word
