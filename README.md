# Planet Ethereum
The Ethereum ecosystem is growing, and growing fast. There are many amazing teams and individuals buidling the awesome infrastructure and tools that we use so much, let's show them some love.

(Read these before? Head straight to the [issues](ETHBerlin.md))

## Goals
The aim of this community project is to research and implement methods which best progress toward these goals:

1. To collect and curate a list of issues, feature requests, ideas, etc. regarding infrastructure and tooling projects, to act as a sort of menu for first-time and regular contributors to go through and pick what they find delicious, thereby helping the projects and the ecosystem.

2. By means of a mechanism (upvote, QV, ...), we can signal the items which many people care about and want to see implemented.

3. To provide a means for experienced community members to mentor those who are new and learning.

4. As the planet is largely unexplored, to make it easy to experiment, and reduce the cost of experimentation, by stressing a strong devtool infrastructure.

5. To push people to #buidl in preperation for upcoming hackathon and community gatherings.

6. To facilitate the exchange of ideas, and through that, the forming of teams, who in turn start new adventures.

7. And above all, to encourage a spirit of collaboration, and increase network effects.
