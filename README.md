## Vision
A thriving Ethereum ecosystem, with a spirit of collaboration and experimentation, and a strong network effect, that promotes the values we believe in.

## Mission
This community project strives to research and implement efficient methods which progress towards the following goals:

1. As the planet is largely unexplored, to make it easy to experiment, and reduce the cost of experimentation, by stressing a strong devtool infrastructure.
2. Invest in educational efforts.
3. Facilitate the exchange of ideas, and thereby, the formation of teams, who in turn start new adventures.
4. Practice decentralized organization.
5. Support projects which benefit the community, but don't yet have a viable mean of sustaining themselves.
6. Encourage value-driven development.
7. Encourage a spirit of collaboration, and increase network effects.

## Values
- Transparency
- Openness
- Decentralization
- Inclusivity
- Fairness
- Sustainability
