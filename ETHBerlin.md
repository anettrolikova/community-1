# ETHBerlin
The non-tiring team behind ETHBerlin has such a great event planned. It's going to be legendary!

They have also made a commitment to mainly use dapps for their various requirements,
such as for video streaming, communcations, etc. There is no need to sing the praises of this resolution (and tradition).

In preperation for this, the teams are working hard to polish their dapps and fix some of the more important issues
and to get them to work (even more) smoothly for the event.

The same line of thought could be applied to devtools. Let's make it super easy for the hackers at ETHBerlin to experiment
and innovate by finding issues that hackers could face and writing new small tools and plugins that are good for bootstraping projects
to allow them to get started on their actual idea and use case.
